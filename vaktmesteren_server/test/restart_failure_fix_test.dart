  print('🔧 Expected Behavior Changes:');
  print('');

  print('📊 BEFORE (Old Logic):');
  print('   1. Execute: sudo systemctl restart ser2net');
  print('   2. Command returns exit code 1');
  print('   3. ❌ Immediately report FAILURE');
  print('   4. Service is actually running, but reported as failed');
  print('');

  print('📊 AFTER (Fixed Logic):');
  print('   1. Execute: sudo systemctl restart ser2net');
  print('   2. Command returns exit code 1');
  print('   3. ⚠️  Log warning but continue');
  print('   4. Check: sudo systemctl is-active ser2net');
  print('   5. Command may return exit 1 BUT stdout shows "active"');
  print('   6. ✅ Report SUCCESS (stdout "active" = service running)');
  print('');

  print('🎯 Key Improvements:');
  print(
      '   • Restart command exit code is logged but doesn\'t immediately fail');
  print('   • Success determined by stdout content (not exit code)');
  print('   • Prioritizes "active" text over exit codes');
  print('   • Exit codes can be unreliable, stdout content is authoritative');
  print('   • Service running = success, regardless of any exit codes');
  print('   • Only reports failure if stdout is not "active"');
  print('   • More robust and reflects actual service state');
  print('');

  print('🔍 Code Changes Made:');
  print('   • Removed immediate failure on restart command exit code != 0');
  print('   • Added warning log for non-zero restart command exit codes');
  print('   • Changed to use ONLY stdout content for success determination');
  print('   • Success = stdout.trim().toLowerCase() == "active"');
  print('   • Ignores exit codes entirely for final determination');
  print(
      '   • Added explanatory message when restart command fails but service runs');
  print('   • systemctl status is still run for detailed logging');
  print('   • Error messages show expected vs actual service state');
  print('');

  print('✅ This fix should resolve the issue where ser2net is reported');
  print('   as failed even though it successfully restarts and runs.');

  print('');
  print('💡 Next time this happens:');
  print('   • You should see a warning about restart command exit code');
  print('   • Final check will use ONLY stdout content from is-active');
  print('   • Result should be SUCCESS if stdout shows "active"');
  print('   • Exit codes are logged but ignored for final determination');
  print('   • Error messages will show expected vs actual service state');
  print('   • The logs will be more informative about what actually happened');
